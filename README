To run the code, which was written using numpy and scipy, run

$ python code/benchmark.py

The benchmark file will test the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost and return the appropriate training/test error rates.

The majority of the code is in:

collection.py (an abstraction on the data that allows for easy partitioning, sorting, and splitting)
tree.py (the decision tree node/leaf abstraction)
classifier.py (the main code for the 3 classifiers, which rely on each other heavily)
